# audio_video_pairing
This repository has the *AV_pairing* module that contains a set of functions to spatially align trajectory estimates derived from two tracking
systems eg. acoustic and video tracking. This module was primarily written to assign unlabelled acoustically localised points to known traject-
ories, perform rigid transforms between acoustic and video data and various other data cleaning operations between the trajectory outputs of
the acoustic localisation package TOADsuite (Goerlitz lab) and 3d video tracking package [DLTdv](https://www.unc.edu/~thedrick/software1.html) (Hedrick lab).
